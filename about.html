<h1> About Me </h1>
<p> Hello all and welcome to my page!</p>
<br />
<p> My name is Keegan, I am 22 years old and I adore pigs.</p>
<p> Ever since I was young I have had an odd fascination with pigs. It was all about the appearance of the pigs for me though, what with their little snouts and boarderline smiling faces? Who couldn't?</p>
<p>As of recently in my adult years I have switched my diet around and stopped consuming animals. A light switched on in my head one day and I thought to myself "Would I eat a dog?" "I know other coultures eat dogs...but would I ever eat Lassie?" My answer was "HELL NO!" That bitch could probably lead me to some water, fresh vegetables maybe even a Taco Bell if she were with me while I was lost in a terrain, forrest or my backyard. Not that that would ever happen, but if I trust even an ounce of my life with an animal of any kind why would I eat it or its friends? </p>
<p>On top of my love for swine, its scientifically proven that pigs are even smarter than dogs, they are super clean and they are severely abused in the meat industry.</p>
<br />
<p><b> Anyway,</b> I love animals and this is just part of my omage for pigs along with something to help me learn programming.</p>

<p> Enjoy! </p>
